# DATA ANALYSIS ON THE PISA DATASET
## by Igweze Ifeanyi


## Dataset

> This is a dataset which examines how well students have learned the school curricullum and how well prepared they are for life beyond school, all from 510,000 students in 65 economies took part in the PISA 2012 assessment of reading, mathematics and science. Of those economies, 44 took part in an assessment of creative problem solving and 18 in an assessment of financial literacy. During wrangling I removed null values, took away columns I had no use of, renamed some columns, calculated and created the average column etc.


## Summary of Findings

> During the exploratory analysis I focused on how the presence of parents affects the scores of students. From the EDA we uncovered that the presence of parents, especially when both parents are present student scores are better. I observed native students perform better others. The only observation that puzzled me was the the fact students performed better spending less time with their parents.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> From my EDA I uncovered what I choose to call an anomaly, the fact though students perfom better with their parents, the more time they spend the less their scores are. Due to the negative correlation I choose to focus my slides on this, showing a bivariate and multivariate visualization demonstrating the relationship between the variables.
